emerge is a code analysis tool to gather insights about source code structure, metrics, dependencies and complexity of software projects. You can use it to scan the source code of a project, calculate metric results and statistics, map the source code to graph structures (e.g. a dependency graph or a filesystem graph), export the results in other file formats and even create an **interactive web application** for further exploration. emerge currently has scanning support for the following languages: `C`, `C++`, `Groovy`, `Java`, `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `Kotlin`, `ObjC`, `Ruby`, `Swift`, `Python`. The structure, coloring and clustering is calculated and based on the idea of combining a [force-directed graph](https://github.com/d3/d3-force) simulation and [Louvain modularity](https://github.com/taynaud/python-louvain). emerge is mainly written in Python 3 and is tested on macOS, linux and modern web browsers (i.e. latest Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

## Goals of this project

*emerge* (/…™Ààm…ôÀêd í/)

> - to appear by coming out of something or out from behind something
> - to become known, especially as a result of examining something or asking questions about it

The main goal of this project is to create a free/ open source tool, that can easily be used by anyone with interest in software development, architecture, metrics and visualization to gather more insights about those topics. It should facilitate/ support getting a better understanding of a given software project.

## The following features are currently supported by emerge

- File scan support for the following languages: `C`, `C++`, `Groovy`, `Java`, `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `Kotlin`, `ObjC`, `Ruby`, `Swift`, `Python`
- Basic entity scan/extraction (e.g. classes) for the following languages: `Groovy`, `Java`, `Kotlin`, `Swift`
- Basic implementation of the following software metrics: SLOC, Number of Methods, Fan-In/Fan-Out, Modularity (Louvain)
- Logging support with configurable log levels
- Configuration support based on YAML syntax to configure multiple/specific analyses
- Export of scan results/ metrics/ statistics for the following formats/ outputs
  - Code dependency, inheritance, complete and filesystem graph (enriched with scan results/metrics)
  - [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org)
  - [Graphviz DOT format](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html)
  - JavaScript format suited for a [D3 force graph simulation](https://github.com/d3/d3-force)
  - Interactive HTML/ web application for interactive, exploratory analysis and data visualization of your project based on graph structures
    - HTML app is based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
    - Force-directed graph simulation by [D3](https://d3js.org)
    - The node colors are based on [Louvain modularity](https://github.com/taynaud/python-louvain) with a bit of post-processing to make the graph coloring more deterministic and stable
    - Fast full-screen UI rendering on HTML canvas
    - Visualization of files, entities and given metrics
    - [dark mode support](https://github.com/coliff/dark-mode-switch)
    - Reactive visual live search of files/ entities (e.g. classes)
    - Selection and highlighting of individual nodes
    - [Concave hull](https://github.com/AndriiHeonia/hull) visualization of single clusters
    - Display of cluster metrics to facilitate comparability
    - Interactivity given by translation, zooming, dragging and hovering over nodes
  - Tabular console output
  - Tabular file output
  - JSON file output

## How to install and use emerge

At this time there is no simple installation by using pip (tbd), so the following steps should guide you how to install this tool and get it running.

### **1.** Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/glato/emerge.git
```

### **2.1** (*macOS*) Install the `graphviz` package first

```
brew install graphviz
```

### **2.2** (*macOS*) Create a virtual environment
Check of you have the latest Python 3 installed on your macOS. I recommend installing/using Python 3 from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). Create a Python 3 virtual environment (optionally within the project structure)

```
cd emerge
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3 venv
```

### **2.** (*ubuntu*) Create a virtual environment
Install required packages and create a Python 3 virtual environment (optionally within the project structure)

```
apt-get install python3-venv python3-dev graphviz graphviz-dev
cd emerge
python3 -m venv venv
```

### **3.** Before using/working with the tool, activate the virtual environment

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

### **4.** (*macOS*) Install all dependencies
Install all required dependencies for the project with pip

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4.** (*ubuntu*) Install all dependencies
Install the wheel package, after that install all required dependencies for the project with pip

```
pip install wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **5.** Running unit tests from the command line

```
python run_tests.py
```

### **6.** Running EMERGE as a standalone tool

```
python emerge.py 
usage: emerge.py [-h] [-c YAMLCONFIG] [-v] [-d] [-s]

Welcome to emerge x.y.z (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss).

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c YAMLCONFIG, --config YAMLCONFIG
                        set yaml config file
  -v, --verbose         set logging level to INFO
  -d, --debug           set logging level to DEBUG
  -s, --silent          run silently without any console output
```

### **7.** You're ready to go üò±
Let's quickly try to run emerge on its own codebase

```
python emerge.py -c configs/emerge.yaml
```

This should produce a similar output:

### **8.** Start your web app
Now just copy the above mentioned `file://` path to any modern web browser and interactively expore the emerge codebase üòâ

#### **8.1** Currently emerge offers the following keyboard shortcuts in the interactive web app:

- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Hovering over a node and pressing the key `s` to select and highlight or deselect a specific node
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Resetting the currently active node selection by pressing the `r` key
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Fading all unselected nodes to have a more highlighted visualization of you currenty selected nodes by pressing the `f` key

And now let's make this more interesting ...

## Further configuration (using emerge on other projects)

If you wand to use emerge on other projects, you can simple copy or customize one of the existing configuration templates from the `emerge/configs` directory.

### **9.** Scan a real project
For a quick run, it should be enough to adjust `source_directory`, `directory` in `export`.

```yaml
---
project_name: c-example-project
loglevel: info
analyses:
- analysis_name: check_c_files
  source_directory: /Users/user1/emerge/project/source/github/linux-5.8.5/crypto
  only_permit_languages:
  - c
  only_permit_file_extensions:
  - .c
  - .h
  ignore_dependencies_containing:
  - string.h
  file_scan:
  - number_of_methods
  - source_lines_of_code
  - dependency_graph
  - louvain_modularity
  - fan_in_out
  export:
  - directory: /Users/user1/emerge/project/export
  - graphml
  - dot
  - json
  - tabular_file
  - tabular_console_overall
  - d3
```
### **10.** Run emerge with a specific yaml configuration
After customizing a present config (e.g. `config/c-template.yaml`) or creating your own, just run emerge again with this new config

```bash
python emerge.py -c configs/c-template.yaml
```


After the scan, your scan output (including your interactive web app) can be found at the directory that you created and set in the config parameter `export` -> `directory`, as seen in the logs above.

A full YAML configuration that contains both file and entity scan has the following format:

```yaml
---
project_name: java_project_example
loglevel: info
analyses:
- analysis_name: check_java_files_and_classes
  source_directory: /Users/user1/emerge/project/source
  only_permit_languages:
  - java
  only_permit_file_extensions:
  - .java
  ignore_dependencies_containing:
  - java.util
  file_scan:
  - number_of_methods
  - source_lines_of_code
  - dependency_graph
  - fan_in_out
  - louvain_modularity
  entity_scan:
  - dependency_graph
  - source_lines_of_code
  - number_of_methods
  - fan_in_out
  - louvain_modularity
  export:
  - directory: /Users/user1/emerge/project/export
  - graphml
  - dot
  - json
  - tabular_file
  - tabular_console_overall
  - d3
