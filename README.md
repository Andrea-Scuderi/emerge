emerge is a code analysis tool that can be used to gather insights about source code structure, metrics, dependencies and complexity of software projects. It can scan the source code of a project, calculate metric results and statistics, map the source code to graph structures (e.g. a dependency graph or a filesystem graph) and further export the results in some file formats or even create an **interactive web application** for further exploration. The structure, coloring and clustering is calculated and based on the idea of combining a [force-directed graph](https://github.com/d3/d3-force) simulation and [Louvain modularity](https://github.com/taynaud/python-louvain). emerge is mainly written in Python 3 and is tested on macOS, linux and modern web browsers (i.e. latest Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

## Goals of this project

*emerge* (/…™Ààm…ôÀêd í/)

> - to appear by coming out of something or out from behind something
> - to become known, especially as a result of examining something or asking questions about it

The main goal of this project is to create a free/ open source tool, that can easily be used by anyone with interest in software development, architecture, metrics and visualization to gather more insights about those topics. It should facilitate/ support getting a better understanding of a given a software project.

## The following features are currently supported by emerge

- File scan support for the following languages: C, Groovy, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Kotlin, ObjC, Ruby, Swift
- Basic entity scan/extraction (e.g. classes) for the following languages: Groovy, Java, Kotlin, Swift
- Basic implementation of the following software metrics: SLOC, Number of Methods, Fan-In/Fan-Out, Modularity (Louvain)
- Logging support with configurable log levels
- Configuration support based on YAML syntax to configure multiple/specific analyses
- Export of scan results/ metrics/ statistics for the following formats/ outputs
  - Code dependency, inheritance, complete and filesystem graph (enriched with scan results/metrics)
  - [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org)
  - [Graphviz DOT format](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html)
  - JavaScript format suited for a [D3 force graph simulation](https://github.com/d3/d3-force)
  - Interactive HTML/ web application for interactive, exploratory analysis and data visualization of your project based on graph structures
    - HTML app is based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
    - Force-directed graph simulation by [D3](https://d3js.org)
    - Fast full-screen UI rendering on HTML canvas
    - Visualization of files, entities and given metrics
    - [dark mode support](https://github.com/coliff/dark-mode-switch)
    - Reactive visual live search of files/ entities (e.g. classes)
    - Interactivity given by translation, zooming, dragging and hovering over nodes
  - Tabular console output
  - Tabular file output
  - JSON file output

## How to install and use emerge

At this time there is no simple installation by using pip (tbd), so the following steps should guide you how to install this tool and get it running.

**1.** Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/glato/emerge.git
```

**2.1** (*macOS*) Install the `graphviz` package first

```
brew install graphviz
```

**2.2** (*macOS*) Check of you have the latest Python 3 installed on your macOS. I recommend installing/using Python 3 from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). Create a Python 3 virtual environment (optionally within the project structure)

```
cd emerge
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3 venv
```

**2.** (*ubuntu*) Install required packages and create a Python 3 virtual environment (optionally within the project structure)

```
apt-get install python3-venv python3-dev graphviz graphviz-dev
cd emerge
python3 -m venv venv
```

**3.** Before using/working with the tool, activate the virtual environment

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

**4.** (*macOS*) Install all required dependencies for the project with pip

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4.** (*ubuntu*) Install the wheel package, after that install all required dependencies for the project with pip

```
pip install wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**5.** Running unit tests from the command line

```
python run_tests.py
```

**6.** Running EMERGE as a standalone tool

```
python emerge.py 
usage: emerge.py [-h] [-c YAMLCONFIG] [-v] [-d] [-s]

Welcome to emerge x.y.z (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss).

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c YAMLCONFIG, --config YAMLCONFIG
                        set yaml config file
  -v, --verbose         set logging level to INFO
  -d, --debug           set logging level to DEBUG
  -s, --silent          run silently without any console output
```

**7.** Create a YAML configuration for your scan or copy/adjust a template example from the configs directory. The template examples in `emerge/configs` should be mostly self-documenting. For a quick run, it's enough to adjust `source_directory` and `directory` in `export`.

```yaml
---
project_name: c-example-project
loglevel: info
analyses:
- analysis_name: check_c_files
  source_directory: /Users/user1/emerge/project/source/github/linux-5.8.5/crypto
  only_permit_languages:
  - c
  only_permit_file_extensions:
  - .c
  - .h
  ignore_dependencies_containing:
  - string.h
  file_scan:
  - number_of_methods
  - source_lines_of_code
  - dependency_graph
  - louvain_modularity
  - fan_in_out
  export:
  - directory: /Users/user1/emerge/project/export
  - graphml
  - dot
  - json
  - tabular_file
  - tabular_console_overall
  - d3
```

**8.** Running EMERGE with a specific YAML configuration (e.g. a customized `emerge/config/c-template.yaml`)

```
python emerge.py -c configs/c-template.yaml
```

... which should produce a similar output:

```

  file_scan:
  - number_of_methods
  - source_lines_of_code
  - dependency_graph
  - fan_in_out
  - louvain_modularity
  entity_scan:
  - dependency_graph
  - source_lines_of_code

- Parsing of further entity types for more languages is planned for further development. [Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome üëç

## Further development

- *Disclaimer*: The current version (0.13.3) is not yet stable, probably still has some üêû and is probably not yet suited for productive usage.
- Everyone is invited to contribute to this project, whether the contribution is related with development, testing, bug reporting or any other support. I would appreciate any help üëç. See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Credits](CREDITS.md) for further details.
